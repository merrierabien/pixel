		<h2>Floating Island</h2>
		<p class="post"><br/><br/><br/>I drew this for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/luigisalas_/?theme=dark">Luigi Salas</a>'s  Draw This In Your Style organized to celebrate his 20 000 followers on Instagram.
The floating island was very inspiring. The first time I saw the original, I immediately pictured the isometric scene in my mind and sketched it on a notebook. I started working on it as soon as I could.<br>
It is all about volumes. Once I had them, they needed to be polished and surfaces needed some texture. This last part is probably the most difficult for me, but I think the result is fine.<br>At the beginning, the drawing was supposed to be smaller, centered on the island. I found it too narrowed and too close to the island. I decided at the very end that there was going to be a wide sky with enormous clouds. It gives a feeling of vastness which contrasts a lot with the small character sat on the edge of the road.<br>It is one of my favorite creations.<p>
