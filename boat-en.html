		<h2>Paper Boat</h2>
		<p class="post"><br/><br/><br/>Origami is always something fun to do. I think it is impressive to make complex and beautiful structures just by folding paper.<br/>Here, I challenged myself to draw a paper boat. I had to learn how to make them, and make a lot of boats. By making a lot of boats, I could understand the lines and folds to draw them correctly. I made my paper boats with already used sheets of paper which would have been thrown away if I had not taken them. It gives them a second life and now I have plenty of boats to decorate my room.<br/>I wanted the boat to go on water, just because it is a boat. I never tried to put a paper boat on water, but I am almost sure it would drown.<br/>It's one of the first drawings in pixel art which satisfied me.
